Rapid-python-introduction
=========================

After giving it a lot of thought, I am now wanting to implement this idea of conducting workshops / tutorials on python at MakeMyTrip specially designed for people who need to deal with lot of scripting.

I have curated the content in such a way, that people can stay away from perils of programming but still write efficient code that will help them speed up their tasks.

How :
=====

I found IPython notebook was a perfect tool for creating lessons. I write a few notes about a topic, then write a small program to illustrate how to implement the topic in code. IPython Notebook makes it easy to develop these lessons locally, and GitHub makes it easy to store these notebooks in a publicly accessible place. The IPython Notebook Viewer then makes them available in a reader-friendly format.

Apart from that, I want to have face-to-face sessions as well for which I need to figure out a schedule (depending upon the number of people.)

My basic workflow:
==================

* I created a notebook for the syllabus Iâ€™d like to follow.
* For each topic in the syllabus, I create a local notebook which will hold lessons for that topic.
* When I have time, I create lessons at home and push them live.
* I always teach with my computer hooked up to a projector. When I clarify something during a lesson, I push the changes to GitHub as soon as the lesson is over.
* If I cover a new topic in class, I write my examples directly in one of the notebooks. If the live work is clean enough, I push it straight to GitHub. If the live work needs a bit of cleanup, I commit locally and then push it live after class, when I have the chance to look it over more carefully.
* If a student starts to outpace me, I can steer them into something more established such as Udacity or Coursera. These are the students who are likely to be successful in more independent learning settings.
